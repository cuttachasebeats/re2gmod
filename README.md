So I decided to finally release this to the public. This gamemode has be worked on by Cutta Chase Beats and<br> 
"Noobulator" (Can't Find On Steam). There has been lots of bug fixes and lots of new added content.<br> 
The gamemode is basically complete. just added more content is my next thing 
* Escape Maps 
* New Modes 
* More Bug Fixes

NOTE: Can Only Host Gamemode Dedicated (Listening Server Has Not Been Tested But Has Been Reported Working)<br>
NOTE: server.cfg must have sv_gravity 400 & sv_alltalk 3

Gamemode Requires CS:S (HL2:EP2 if you want all textures and errors fixed)

I want to thank Lighterchu, King David, Gonzo, White Knuckles, Teirafly, & Ludwig for helping me with<br> 
this project and noobulator for giving me the rights to the gamemode

NOTE: PVP Mode Is Still In Development and has been disabled for the time being<br>
NOTE: Some Maps Have Exploits, Will Fix OverTime<br>
NOTE: Saves Are Generated As A Folder (STEAMID) with a text (playerinfo) showing stats. Adjusting<br> 
money is only done from here(save changes during mapchange). !!!!!!Do Not Change Any Other<br> 
Stats, Will Break Client Buy/Inventory Menus)!!!!!!
